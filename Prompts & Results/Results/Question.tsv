Establish an ontology based on {noun}.		Establish an ontology based on Question.	Ontology in the context of AI and computer science refers to a representation, formal naming and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse.Based on "Question", an ontology could look like this:1. Superclass: Communication- Subclass: Language-- Element: Vocabulary--- Subcategory: Questions---- Types: Open-ended question, yes/no question, multiple choice question----- Aspect: Syntax (i.e. structuring of the question)----- Aspect: Semantics (i.e. meaning of the question)----- Aspect: Context (i.e. when and where the question is being asked)----- Process: Asking----- Process: Interpreting----- Process: Responding2. Superclass: Inquiry - Subclass: Research -- Element: Methodology --- Subcategory: Interview ---- Type: Structured interview (list of pre-decided questions) ---- Type: Semi-structured interview (guide of questions, but with flexibility) ---- Type: Unstructured interview (no predetermined questions) ----- Component: Preparation of questions ----- Process: Conducting interview ----- Process: Analyzing responses 3. Superclass: Learning- Subclass: Education-- Element: Pedagogy--- Subcategory: Socratic questioning (asking a series of questions to stimulate critical thinking)--- Aspect: Purpose (e.g. to test knowledge, stimulate thought, spark discussion)--- Process: Crafting of questions--- Process: Delivery of questions--- Process: Assessment of answers   With further detailing, this ontology can have more granularity for a more specific domain. These categories can be extended further and pruned based on the specific usage of the ontology.

The ontology includes the concept of a question, the possible answers to a question, and the user who asked it.- The class `Question` represents any question. It has properties like `hasTitle`, `hasContent`, `hasSpecificDate` to define the title, content and specific date of the question. The `relatedTo` property allows us to link a question to its related topics or questions.- Similarly, the class `Answer` under class `Question` represents any answer. The property `hasAnswer` links a question to its answers.- The `SingleChoiceAnswer` and `MultipleChoiceAnswer` classes under the `Answer` class. - `User` class uses these properties to define the user who asked the question in the system with the `asked` property. - For the data types, standard XML schema datatypes like xsd:string, xsd:date are used.

The "Question" can be further divided into two subclasses "Open-ended Question" and "Closed-ended Question". Based on the type of question, it holds specific properties like "ExpectedAnswerType" for open-ended questions and "Options" and "CorrectOption" for closed-ended questions. Other properties of a question might include its difficulty, subject, creation date, etc. Meanwhile, a "User" who creates the question holds properties like username, email, etc.

Design Pattern for Question in Ontology:1. Class: QuestionThis is the main concept of our pattern. A Question is an abstract idea that contains a query or a prompt seeking answer(s).Properties:    -hasText:: String â€“ The actual text of the question.    -hasCategory:: Category â€“ The category or domain to which the question belongs to.    -hasDifficultyLevel:: DifficultyLevel â€“ The level of difficulty of the question(e.g., easy, medium, hard).    -hasAnswer:: Answer â€“ The correct answer(s) to the question.    -hasMultipleChoiceOptions:: MultipleChoiceOptions â€“ The choices of multiple-choice questions.2. Class: CategoryThis class represents the category or domain of the question(e.g., Math, Science, History, etc.).Properties:    -hasName:: String â€“ The name of the category.    -hasRelatedQuestions:: Question â€“ The list of questions that fall under this category.3. Class: DifficultyLevelThis class represents the degree of difficulty of the question.Properties:    -hasLevel:: String â€“ The actual level description(e.g., easy, medium, hard).    -hasRelatedQuestions:: Question â€“ The list of questions that have this level of difficulty.4. Class: AnswerThis class represents the correct response to the question.Properties:     -hasText:: String â€“ The actual answer text.5. Class: MultipleChoiceOptionsThis class could be used if the question is a multiple-choice question.Properties:     -hasOptions:: String â€“ The list of options in string format.This model can be extended based on the requirement but it provides a basic design pattern for representing a Question in an ontology.

It has two properties, `ex:hasContent` which represents the content of the question and `ex:hasAnswer` which represents the answer to the question. Both properties have the `ex:Question` as their domain and text (xsd:string) as their range. This means these properties will connect instances of the `ex:Question` class with their text contents and answers.
Is it possible for you to create a straightforward pattern to depict {noun} ontologically?		Is it possible for you to create a straightforward pattern to depict Question ontologically?	Creating a straightforward pattern to depict a question ontologically can be a bit complex, as it involves abstract concepts and numerous possibilities. However, a simplified way might be like the following:1. Entity: This may refer to the person or system that is posing the question.2. Intent: This refers to the reason or purpose behind the question. It could be to seek knowledge, clarify a misunderstanding, make a decision, etc.3. Content: This is the actual subject matter of the question. It could relate to objects, people, places, events, concepts, and so on.4. Format: This describes the way the question is structured or presented. It could be a yes/no question, multiple-choice question, open-ended question, and so on.5. Recipient: This may refer to the person or system that is expected to answer the question.So ontologically, a Question could be defined as:Question(Entity, Intent, Content, Format, Recipient)

Would you be able to generate a basic pattern for {noun}'s ontological representation?		Would you be able to generate a basic pattern for Question's ontological representation?	Yes, a basic ontological representation for a question could be:1. Entity: Which is the main subject, object, or context about which the question is being asked.2. Predicate: This indicates the action, relation, or property associated with the entity.3. Parameters: These provide additional information about the predicate. They might refer to aspects such as time, place, method, purpose, etc.4. Question Word: This indicates what type of response is required. Examples include "What", "When", "Where", "Why", "How", etc.Example:"Where did Maria buy the book?"- Entity: Maria- Predicate: Buy- Parameters: The book- Question Word: WhereIn ontological terms, this could be represented as:- Class: Person (Subclass: Maria)- Relation: hasPerfomedAction (Action: Buy)- Relation: hasTargetObject (Object: Book)- Relation: location is unknown Note: This is a highly simplified representation. In reality, ontological representations can become complex involving multiple entities, predicates and parameters depending on the complexity of the question.

Would you be able to generate a basic pattern for Question's ontological representation? Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Sure, here's a basic pattern in Turtle format:```turtle@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .@prefix ex: <http://example.org/#> .ex:Question rdf:type rdfs:Class .ex:hasQuestionText rdf:type rdf:Property ;    rdfs:range xsd:string ;    rdfs:domain ex:Question .ex:askedBy rdf:type rdf:Property ;    rdfs:range ex:User ;    rdfs:domain ex:Question .```In this pattern, I assume there's a `Question` class, and two properties related to it â€” `hasQuestionText` and `askedBy`. `hasQuestionText` is a string describing the question, whilst `askedBy` points towards the `User` who asked the question. Note that this is a very basic pattern, and the actual representation of a question in a real-world application could be much more complex and involve other classes and properties too.
Are you able to design a simple framework within an ontology to embody {noun}?		Are you able to design a simple framework within an ontology to embody Question?	As an AI, I can surely provide a basic framework within an ontology to represent a Question. Within an ontology, entities consist of classes, subclasses, individuals, and relationships. For a Question, the framework can look something like this:1. Class: Question - This will be the main class or the category in our ontology.2. Subclasses: This could include different types of questions such as Open-ended Question, Closed-ended Question, Multiple Choice Question, Yes-or-No Question, etc. Each subclass further defines specific characteristics or properties of its parent class.3. Properties: These are the attributes or specifics related to the category Question. This could include properties like 'hasDifficultyLevel', 'hasOption', 'hasCorrectAnswer' etc. 4. Relationships: These indicate how the classes are connected or related to each other. For example, 'isTypeOf' could be a relationship connecting the main class 'Question' to its subclasses. Another relation could be 'askedIn' which may connect 'Question' with 'Quiz or Examination'.5. Individual: An individual instance of Question could be any specific question, like "What is the capital of France?". This individual question would embody all the properties of its parent classes and own unique details.Remember, the purpose of an ontology is to model a domain and define related concepts and relationships. Therefore, the design of your ontology would depend on how detailed or complex you want your question framework to be.

It also includes the properties 'hasQuestionText' for specifying the text of a question and 'hasAnswerText' for specifying the text of an answer.
Could you craft a minimalist design pattern to illustrate {noun} within an ontology?		Could you craft a minimalist design pattern to illustrate Question within an ontology?	Sure, Let's consider a basic example of question pertaining to the domain of a "Library":1. Class: Book   - Attribute: Title    - Attribute: Author    - Attribute: Publication_year 2. Class: Question   - Attribute: Type (Type of question. Can be 'What', 'Who', 'When', etc.)   - Attribute: Content (The question itself)   - Relationship: about a Book (A question can be about a specific book)An example of a question instance might look like: - Question 1: What is the title of the book?    - Type: 'What'    - Content: 'What is the name of the book?'    - about: Book (The book in question)- Question 2: Who is the author of the book?    - Type: 'Who'    - Content: 'Who is the author of the book?'    - about: Book (The book in question) This is a simple design pattern with an ontology that represents a question about a book within a library. It can be expanded and sophisticated based on the complexity of the ontology and the domain to which the question pertains.

This class has two properties, `:hasTitle` and `:hasBody`. `:question1` is an instance of a question.This is a basic pattern, but ontologies can be much more intricate depending on the context. They can include many more classes, properties, and instances, and may have more complex relationships.
Can you establish a basic structure for encapsulating {noun} in ontology terms?		Can you establish a basic structure for encapsulating Question in ontology terms?	Absolutely. Here's a basic structure of how a "Question" can be encapsulated in ontology terms:1. Entity: The first part of an ontology structure is "entity." Regarding a question, this entity can be regarded as the "Question" itself.2. Subclasses: Subclasses are a portion of the question which falls under the entity. For a "Question," subclasses can be various types of questions like "Open-ended Questions," "Closed-ended Questions," "Leading Questions," etc.3. Properties: Properties describe characteristics of the entity and its subclasses. In the context of a question, properties could be various elements like "Question Word," "Subject," "Helping Verb," etc.4. Relationships: Relationships will depict how various entities, subclasses, and properties relate to one another. For example, a "Question" can have a relationship with the "Respondent" who answers it or even the "Survey" where it might be used.5. Instances: Instances represent the individual real-world examples of the entity. In terms of questions, instances could be actual questions like, "What is your favorite color?" or "Do you enjoy reading?" etc.This is a generalized structure and should be adapted according to the specific requirements of the project in hand.

Would you create a straightforward ontology model to capture {noun}?		Would you create a straightforward ontology model to capture Question?	Creating an ontology model for a 'Question' could be somewhat complicated given the broad nature of the term. However, in a very straightforward concept, it would look something like this:1. Base class ('Thing') - This is the most general class. In this case, all kinds of 'Questions' would fall under this category.2. Subclasses - These are specific types of 'Questions'. This could include categories like 'Closed Questions' (those that can be answered with a 'yes' or 'no'), 'Open Questions' (those that require more detailed answers), 'Multi-choice Questions' (those that offer multiple options for answers), and 'Leading Questions' (those that guide the respondent towards a certain answer).3. Properties - These are specific aspects or characteristics of 'Questions'. Examples might include 'Difficulty Level', 'Subject Matter', etc.4. Individuals - These are specific instances of 'Questions'. They belong to one of the subclasses and have properties associated with them.5. Relationships - These are the connections between different classes, subclasses, and individuals. In the case of 'Questions', one example could be the relationship between a 'Question' and its 'Answer'. This simplified ontology model could be part of a larger model for something like a 'Quiz' or 'Test' structure, where you might also have classes for 'Quiz', 'Section', 'Result', etc. and relationships like 'contains' (a Quiz contains Questions), 'attempts' (a Student attempts a Question), and so on.

I am sorry for the confusion but your request is a bit ambiguous. You are asking for a pattern to convey Question's concept through ontology in Turtle/RDF format. But, no specific ontology, concept domain or entities are mentioned. However, here is an example to show how it may look:```turtle@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .@prefix ex: <http://example.com/> .ex:Question a rdfs:Class ;    rdfs:label "Question" ;    rdfs:comment "Representation of Question in ontology" .ex:hasQuestion a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain ex:User ;    rdfs:range ex:Question ;    rdfs:label "has question" ;    rdfs:comment "Property linking User with a Question they asked." .ex:User a rdfs:Class ;    rdfs:label "User" ;    rdfs:comment "Representation of User in ontology" .```In this example, we define "Question" and "User" as classes in our ontology, and "hasQuestion" as a relationship between a "User" and a "Question" they asked. Please be more specific with concept and domain if you need a more exact answer.
Could you devise a simple scheme for representing {noun} within an ontology context?		Could you devise a simple scheme for representing Question within an ontology context?	Sure, here's a simple way to represent a Question within an ontology context:1. Class: Question   - Subclass: Multiple Choice Question, True-False Question, Open-Ended Question, Fill-in-the-blank Question, etc (if necessary).2. Properties/attributes of 'Question' class could include:   - questionText (string): Contains the actual text of the question.   - correctAnswer (string or URI): Represents the correct answer to the question.   - offeredAnswer (string or URI, possibly multiple): Contains the answers offered to the user (for multiple-choice questions).   - difficultyLevel (string or int): Represents the difficulty level of the question.3. Relations between 'Question' and other entities could include:   - Make 'Question' a subclass of a more general 'AssessmentItem' class, if there are other similar classes (e.g., 'PracticalTask').   - isPartOf (relation to 'Test' or 'Quiz' class): Represents the test or quiz which the question is part of.   - isTopicOf (relation to 'Topic' class): Represents the knowledge topic that the question is about.4. Different instances of the 'Question' class could represent individual questions.Remember, the actual classes, properties, and relationships you'd need in an ontology for questions would depend on your particular use case.

Could you develop a basic design pattern for representing the following in an ontology: {noun}		Could you develop a basic design pattern for representing the following in an ontology: Question	Designing a pattern for representing a "Question" in an ontology could involve various objects and relations to accurately reflect the semantics. Here's a basic way to structure this:Classes:1. **Question**: The main object that we are representing. Attributes could include 'questionText' (String), 'creationDate' (Date), 'author' (Person), etc.2. **Answer**: This represents a possible response to the question. It might have attributes such as 'answerText' (String), 'author' (Person), 'dateAnswered' (Date), etc.3. **Person**: This represents the author/creator of the Question or Answer. It could have attributes like 'name' (String), 'birthDate' (Date), 'email' (String), etc.4. **Topic**: This represents the topic or category that the question is related to - 'topicName' (String).Relations:1. **hasAnswer**: Relation between *Question* and *Answer* class. This indicates that a question has been answered.2. **AskedBy**: Relation between *Question* and *Person* class. This indicates which person asked the question.3. **AnsweredBy**: Relation between *Answer* and *Person* class. This describes who answered the question.4. **RelatedTo**: Relation between *Question* and *Topic* class. This describes the topic or category to which a question is related to.Note: This basic ontology can be expanded and customized to cater to specific needs - for instance, including a "complexity level" for questions, a "rating" for answers, etc.

The pattern assumes that "hasAnswer" property can either result in a literal or a URI of an entity that describes the answer in more detail. To apply a stricter specification, you could replace `rdfs:Resource` with `rdfs:Literal` for textual answers only or `ex:Answer` for specific Answer entities only. Similarly, if you have a defined structure for Questions, you could use `ex:Question` as range for some relationships.
Is it possible for you to create a straightforward pattern to depict the following ontologically: {noun}		Is it possible for you to create a straightforward pattern to depict the following ontologically: Question	Sure, here is a simple ontological pattern which might be used to represent a "question":1. Entity/Concept: `Question`2. Attributes/Properties of `Question`: `Question's text`, `Question's type` (e.g., multiple choice, open ended), `Question's difficulty level`3. Relationships:    - `Question` is asked `in` a `Test`/`Quiz`/`Interview`.   - `Question` is asked `By` a `Person`/`Examiner`.   - `Question` has `Answer/s`.   - `Question` is part of a `Topic`. Please note that the actual ontological pattern would likely be more complex and is dependent on the exact requirements of the system where the ontology is being used.

Would you be able to generate a basic pattern for the following's ontological representation: {noun}		Would you be able to generate a basic pattern for the following's ontological representation: Question	Ontology development involves categorizing and defining the relationships between entities. The ontology for a "Question" would be constructed around its components and properties. Below is a basic ontological pattern representation for a question:1. Entity: Question   - Attribute: ID    - Attribute: Text    - Attribute: Difficulty Level    - Attribute: Topic    - Attribute: Type (Multiple choice, True/False, Short answer, Essay, etc.)   - Relationship: Asked By (Related entity: Person)   - Relationship: Answer (Related entity: Answer)   - Relationship: Asked In (Related entity: Context - such as, an examination, a survey, a seminar, a trivia quiz, etc.)2.

Are you able to design a simple framework within an ontology to describe the following: {noun}		Are you able to design a simple framework within an ontology to describe the following: Question	As an AI, I can certainly design a simple conceptual framework within an ontology to describe a question. Here it is:1. Root: The key concept would be the "Question" which is our root in this ontology.2. Sub-concepts: The "Question" can have several sub-concepts or branches such as "type", "context", "format", and "difficulty".3. Further Branches:    - "Type" could categorize into "open-ended", "closed-ended", "binary", "rating", "multiple choice", and so on.   - "Context" could class into "academic", "quiz", "survey", "interview", and more.   - The "format" could break down into "textual", "visual", or "auditory".   - "Difficulty" could differentiate as "easy", "medium", "hard".4. Attributes: Each sub-concept might have specific attributes. For example, "format" would have "length" (number of words or minutes for auditory questions) and "medium" (written, spoken, image, video, etc.).5. Relationships: There could be relationships between these concepts. For instance, "type" might influence "difficulty", or conversely, the "context" might dictate the form of the "question" (multiple choice for quizzes, open-ended for interviews, etc.).This framework provides just one simplified way to construct an ontology to describe a question. The exact details may vary depending on the specific needs of the application or system it is designed for.

There are also properties that have the domain of `Book` and the range of strings which represent the Title of the book (`:title`) and the author (`:author`). An `Author` has a `Name` represented as `:name`, which has the domain of `Person` and `range` as a string.
Could you craft a minimalist design pattern to illustrate the following within an ontology: {noun}		Could you craft a minimalist design pattern to illustrate the following within an ontology: Question	In an ontology, everything is understood relative to the concepts or entities it interacts with or shares properties with. Here's a simple design pattern for question.Entities:- Question- Answer- UserProperties / Relationships:- User asks Question - User gives Answer- Question has Answer- Question asked by User- Answer provided by UserThis is a very basic structure but can be expanded depending on the complexity needed. For example, different types of questions might be defined (Multiple Choice Question, Open Ended Question, etc.), or properties such as the date the question was asked, difficulty level of the question and so on.

Could you craft a minimalist design pattern to illustrate the following within an ontology: Question Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Sure, here is a simple RDF/Turtle format:```turtle@prefix ex: <http://example.com#> .ex:Question a rdfs:Class .```This sketch defines an ontology where `Question` is a class on `http://example.com#`. The `a` keyword in Turtle is a shorthand for `rdf:type`, denoting that the subject is of the type specified by the object. `rdfs:Class` itself is part of the RDF Schema vocabulary and represents the concept of a class. By setting `ex:Question a rdfs:Class`, we're simply saying that Question is a class in our ontology.
Can you establish a basic structure for encapsulating the following in ontology terms: {noun}		Can you establish a basic structure for encapsulating the following in ontology terms: Question	Ontology refers to a framework for representing information about the world. It typically includes a vocabulary of terms, and some specification of their meaning. This includes definitions and an indication of how concepts are inter-related, establishing a coherent semantics. If we were to encapsulate "Question" in ontology terms, we could start by defining the basic elements:1. **Concepts/Classes** : This would be 'Question' itself. It could further be subdivided into subclasses such as 'Multiple Choice Question', 'True/False Question', 'Open-ended Question', etc. 2. **Entities/Instances**: These would be examples of the concept. For instance, an entity of the class 'Question' could be 'What is your name?' or 'Who is the current President of the USA?'3. **Attributes**: These would be characteristics or properties that define the concept. The 'Question' class might have attributes such as 'Question Text', 'Answer Choices' (in case of multiple choice), 'Correct Answer' etc. 4. **Relations**: These are associations that exist between different concepts or instances. In the context of a 'Question', a relation could be 'is part_of_quiz', if we're considering a concept of 'Quiz' as part of the ontology.5. **Function and Axioms**: These define the behaviors or rules for the concepts and relations. A function might define how a 'Question' is related to a 'Quiz', and axioms might define rules such as 'Every 'Multiple Choice Question' must have at least two 'Answer Choices''.6. **Events**: These are situations that affect the state of a concept or its relations. In the context of a 'Question', an event could be 'Answered Correctly', 'Answered Incorrectly', or 'Not Answered'.So, with these considerations, it's possible to create a structured representation of 'Question' in ontology terms.

Can you assemble a succinct pattern to convey the following's concept in an ontology: {noun}		Can you assemble a succinct pattern to convey the following's concept in an ontology: Question	Pattern:- Class: Question  - Property: Title  - Property: Content  - Property: Author  - Relationship: Is_About (links to Topic class)  - Relationship: Has_Answer (links to Answer class)    - Attribute: Date_Created  - Attribute: Difficulty_Level- Class: Topic  - Property: Name  - Relationship: Has_Question (links to Question class)- Class: Answer  - Property: Content  - Property: Author   - Relationship: Responds_To (links to Question class)  - Attribute: Date_Created  - Attribute: Accuracy_Level  - Attribute: Upvotes_Count  - Attribute: Downvotes_Count.
Can you assemble a succinct pattern to convey the following's concept in an ontology: {noun}	 Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Can you assemble a succinct pattern to convey the following's concept in an ontology: Question Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Sure, here is an example of how you could represent the concept of a "Question" in a Turtle/RDF format:```turtle@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix ex: <http://example.com/> .ex:Question a rdfs:Class ;    rdfs:comment "A class representing a question."@en .ex:hasQuestion a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain ex:Person ;    rdfs:range ex:Question ;    rdfs:comment "A property representing that a person has a question."@en .ex:person1 ex:hasQuestion ex:question1 .ex:question1 a ex:Question ;    rdfs:label "What is the capital of France?"@en ;    ex:hasAnswer "Paris"@en .ex:hasAnswer a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain ex:Question ;    rdfs:range xsd:string ;    rdfs:comment "A property representing the answer to a question."@en .```In this example, we create a class for "Question", a property "hasQuestion" that denotes a person has a question, and another property "hasAnswer" that denotes the answer to a question. This format is written in Turtle but could be converted to regular RDF if necessary. The specific ontology used will depend on the needs of the application and how detailed the representation needs to be.
Could you devise a simple scheme for representing the following within an ontology context: {noun}		Could you devise a simple scheme for representing the following within an ontology context: Question	Sure, I can prepare a basic scheme in an ontology context to handle the concept of a "Question". Here is a simple scheme:- Class: Question    - Property: hasContent        - Type: Text     - Property: hasType         - Type: Category (Example values: 'MultipleChoice', 'True/False', 'ShortAnswer', 'Essay', etc.)     - Property: hasDifficultyLevel        - Type: Category (Example values: 'Easy', 'Medium', 'Hard')     - Property: relatedToTopic        - Type: Text    - Property: hasAnswer        - Type: Answer            - Subproperty: answerText                - Type: text            - Subproperty: isCorrect                - Type: booleanThis is a simple example. Adjust it to your needs for more complexity or special features. Remember that ontology design can be context dependent and can also involve other concepts such as instantiation of specific questions, assigning different weights to different questions, etc.

Could you devise a simple scheme for representing the following within an ontology context: Question Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	The information you've provided is quite vague. But on the base of it, I can provide a simple scheme of ontology context related to a question in Turtle Format/#1:```ttl@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .ex:Question a rdfs:Class ;    rdfs:label "Question" ;    rdfs:comment "A class denoting a question" .ex:askedIn a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain ex:Question ;    rdfs:range rdfs:Resource;    rdfs:label "asked in";    rdfs:comment "A property showing the resource where the question was asked".```The above ontology represents a Question as a class and a property "askedIn" which links the question posed to the resource (like a book, website, forum) where the question was asked.Please specify what kind of question and its context, so I can provide a more detailed and specific ontology.
