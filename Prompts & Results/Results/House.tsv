Build an ontology surrounding the concept of a {noun}.		Build an ontology surrounding the concept of a House.	1. House is a subclass of Building2. House is a superclass of diverse types of houses including:     - Bungalow    - Duplex    - Villa    - Mansion    - Apartment    - Condominium    - Cottage    - Post-modern House    - Ranch-style House    - Townhouse    - Tiny House3. House may have the following components (parts of House):    - Roof    - Door    - Windows    - Rooms        - Bedroom        - Bathroom        - Living Room        - Kitchen        - Dining Room        - Study Room        - Play Room        - Garage    - Basement    - Attic    - Patio    - Yard    - Pool    - Fence    - Chimney4. Properties of the house might include:    - Size (Square Footage, Number of Floors)    - Age (Year Built)    - Number of Rooms (Number of Bedrooms, Number of Bathrooms)    - Material (Brick, Wood, Concrete, etc.)    - Color    - Owner    - Address    - Market Price5. Things that can be performed in a house (actions):    - Cooking    - Sleeping    - Cleaning    - Repairing    - Renovating    - Selling    - Renting    - Buying6. People or individuals associated with the House:    - Residents    - Owner    - Visitors    - Neighbors    - Real Estate Agent    - Architect    - Builder7. House can affect and can be affected by its Neighborhood, as it can determine the value and safety of the House. This is a starting point and can be extended depending on the level of detail and the domain of interest (e.g., real estate, architecture, etc.).

House and Person are classes where House has properties like address, number of rooms, and an owner (which is a person). A Person has a property 'name'. Then, an instance of a house ‘myHouse’ owned by 'JohnDoe' is defined. This ontology is written in the Turtle syntax.
Formulate an ontology related to {noun}.		Formulate an ontology related to House.	An ontology is a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties, and the relations between them.Ontology related to "House" can be as follows:1. Abstraction of House: Residential Building, Property, Real Estate, Structure2. Parts of a House: Living Room, Kitchen, Bedroom, Bathroom, Dining Room, Garage, Basement, Attic, Roof, Walls, Doors, Windows, Stairs, Porch3. Types of House: Detached, Semi-Detached, Bungalow, Mansion, Apartment, Loft, Cottage, Townhouse, Condominium, Duplex, Villa, Mobile home4. Material of House: Bricks, Wood, Steel, Concrete, Glass5. House Ownership: Owner, Tenant, Landlord, Property Manager6. House’s location: Urban, Rural, Suburban, Coastal, Mountainous7. House Maintenance and Improvement: Renovation, Painting, Plumbing, Electrical Work, Insulation, Pest Control8. House Utilities: Electricity, Water, Gas, Heating, Internet, Telephone9. House sale and Purchase: Real Estate Agent, Mortgage, Lease, Rent, Price, Market Value, Property Tax10. House construction: Architect, Contractor, Builder, Blueprint, Zoning Permissions, Building Standards, Construction Material, Timeline, Budget11. House interior: Furniture, Decor, Appliances, Carpeting, Tiling, Lighting fixturesNote: In an ontology, each of these layers could be further broken down. For instance, "Types of House" could branch into subcategories of each kind of house and specific features or elements relating to each.

Establish an ontology based on {noun}.		Establish an ontology based on House.	Creating an ontology helps establish a semantic framework that depicts the hierarchy, relationship, and functions of concepts within a specific field. In this case, the ontology is based on "House". 1. House: This is the principal element in the ontology.   - Types of Houses: This can be further divided into sub-categories like 'bungalows', 'duplex houses', 'apartments', 'villas', 'cottage' etc. Each of these sub-categories can have their own sub-sub-categories.      - For instance, 'apartments' may have 'studio apartments', 'two-bedroom apartments', 'penthouse' etc.  - Parts of a House: Each house consists of multiple elements such as 'living room', 'bedroom', 'kitchen', 'bathrooms', 'garages' etc.     - Each of these rooms can also have sub-categories - for instance, 'bedroom' could have 'Master bedroom', 'Guest bedroom', etc.      - Each room may further contain other entities - For example, 'bathroom' would contain 'sink', 'shower', 'bathtub' etc.  - Construction Materials: It includes 'brick', 'cement', 'wood', 'steel' etc. used during the building process.  - House Characteristics: This could include data like 'square footage', 'number of floors', 'age of house', 'architectural style' etc.  - Ownership Information: This includes information about the 'owner', 'tenants', 'property history' etc.  - Location Information: This would include crucial location-specific details like 'address', 'city', 'state', 'country', 'proximity to amenities' etc.  2. Activities in a House: This includes daily routine activities like 'eating', 'sleeping', 'entertainment', 'maintenance' etc.  - 'Eating' could involve the use of 'kitchen', 'dining room', 'appliances' etc.    - 'Maintenance' could include activities like 'cleaning', 'repairing', 'renovation' etc.3. Services Related to Houses: This consist of 'real estate agencies', 'house inspection services', 'interior design services', 'insurance services' etc.In the ontology of a house, every individual concept can be related to one another to create a complex network illustrating the different aspects and functions of a house. Understanding these relationships can help personalize and optimize our living spaces.

Design an ontology to encompass {noun}.		Design an ontology to encompass House.	Ontologies are useful for structuring knowledge in a formal and understandable way. Here's a simple ontology for a house:Class: House   Subclass: Bungalow   Subclass: Apartment   Subclass: Villa   Subclass: Mansion   Subclass: Townhouse    Properties of House:  - Property: hasAddress  - Property: hasOwner  - Property: hasNumberOfRooms  - Property: hasSize  Relations:  - Relation: isLocatedIn (City/Country)  - Relation: isBuiltIn (Year)Class: Room  Subclass: Bedroom  Subclass: Bathroom  Subclass: Kitchen  Subclass: Living Room  Subclass: Dining RoomProperties of Room:  - Property: hasSize  - Property: hasWindow   - Property: hasFurnitureRelations:  - Relation: isPartOf (House)  Class: Owner   Subclass: Individual   Subclass: CompanyProperties of Owner:   - Property: hasName   - Property: hasContactInformationRelations:   - Relation: owns (House)Please note that this is a simple ontology. Depending on the level of complexity and detail you want your system to have, you might want to add more classes, subclasses, properties, and relations. For example, you might want to include information about the neighborhood where the house is located, the materials used to build the house, the architectural style of the house, etc.

Could you develop a basic design pattern for representing {noun} in an ontology?		Could you develop a basic design pattern for representing House in an ontology?	Sure, here is a simple ontology design pattern to represent a House:1. **Classes**    - House: The main class. A house is a building for people to live in.    - Room: A part of the house, such as the kitchen, bathroom, or bedroom.    - Furniture: Items elsewhere in the house, such as tables, chairs, beds, etc.    2. **Properties**    - hasRoom(House, Room): A property that connects a house with its rooms.    - hasFurniture(Room, Furniture): A property that connects a room of a house with its furniture.    - numberOfRooms(House, integer): A datatype property that connects a house with the number of rooms it has.    - address(House, string): A datatype property that connects a house with its physical address.    3. **Instances**    - For example, House1 can be an instance of the class House, Room1 can be an instance of the class Room, and Bed1 can be an instance of the class Furniture. Then, we can use the property hasRoom to connect House1 with Room1, and the property hasFurniture to connect Room1 with Bed1.4. **Attributes of the houses** (can be modeled either as properties or data values)    - Color: What is the color of the house?    - Size: What is the size of the house (in sqft for instance)?    - Build Year: When was the house built?    - Price: What is the cost of the house?Remember, depending upon the depth of detail you require, this ontology could be expanded or simplified - for example, including more specific types of rooms (e.g. bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, etc.), more specific types of furniture, and so forth.

Is it possible for you to create a straightforward pattern to depict {noun} ontologically?		Is it possible for you to create a straightforward pattern to depict House ontologically?	Yes, it's possible. Below is a simplistic example of a straightforward pattern to depict the ontology of a house:1. House: The topmost concept in the hierarchy. The main essence that is connected to other concepts.2. Building Attributes: This could be things like the number of floors, number of rooms, construction year, color, architectural style, etc. 3. Location: The data about the geographic location of the house. This could be broken down into aspects such as city, neighborhood, street, etc.4. Owners: Information regarding the ownership of the house. This could include current owner, previous owners, etc. 5. House Facilities: Facilities that are included in the house such as garage, garden, swimming pool, etc.Each of these main concepts could be further broken down into specific attributes. For example, the building attributes could be further categorized into number of rooms (which could then be broken down into bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, living room, etc.), architectural style (Victorian, contemporary, etc.), construction year, and so on.In ontology, this hierarchical manner of categorizing things in increasingly specific ways helps to outline all possible aspects and entities related to the concept (in this case, house) in a systematic and logical way.

Is it possible for you to create a straightforward pattern to depict House ontologically? Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Sure, following is a simple ontological depiction of a House in RDF Turtle format :```ttl@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .# Declaring House as a Classex:House a rdfs:Class .# Properties that a House can haveex:hasAddress a rdfs:Property ;  rdfs:domain ex:House ;  rdfs:range rdfs:Literal .ex:hasOwner a rdfs:Property ;  rdfs:domain ex:House ;  rdfs:range ex:Person .# Declaring Person as a Classex:Person a rdfs:Class .# An instance of Houseex:myHouse a ex:House ;  ex:hasAddress "123, Main Street, MyCity, MyCountry" ;  ex:hasOwner ex:JohnDoe .# An instance of Personex:JohnDoe a ex:Person .```In this example, House and Person are defined as classes. The House class has two properties 'hasAddress' and 'hasOwner'. The House instance 'myHouse' has an address ("123, Main Street, MyCity, MyCountry") and an owner 'JohnDoe', which is an instance of the Person class.
Can you formulate a simple ontology pattern that captures the essence of {noun}?		Can you formulate a simple ontology pattern that captures the essence of House?	Pattern name: HouseEntity:1. HouseAttributes:1. HouseAddress - the physical location of the house.2. HouseSize - the total area of the house.3. NumberOfRooms - the total number of rooms in the house.4. ConstructionYear - the year when the house was constructed.5. HouseType - the architectural design or style of the house (e.g. bungalow, apartment, duplex, etc.)6. Owner - the person(s) who owns the house.Relations:1. OwnedBy - a relationship between the house and the person(s) who owns it.2. LocatedAt - a relationship between the house and its physical location.3. HasSize - a relationship between the house and its total area.4.

Creating an ontology for a house's representation can be a complex task as it depends on various aspects like the type of the house, its size, the number of rooms, location, etc. However, here is a very basic pattern or framework:1. `House`    - Unique ID    - Location    - Type (e.g., apartment, villa, bungalow, etc.)    - Floor(s)   2. `Floor(s)`   - Floor Level    - Room(s)3. `Room(s)`    - Type (e.g., bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, etc.)    - Size     - Amenities (e.g., air conditioning, heating, etc.)    - Furniture  4. `Furniture`    - Type (e.g., bed, table, chair, etc.)    - Material    - Color 5. `Amenities`    - Type (e.g., TV, refrigerator, stove, etc.)    - Brand    - Model     - Power consumption This is a top-level pattern and depending on the requirements, it could be simplified or made more complex. For example, you could create sub-categories within amenities for different room types such as "kitchen amenities" and "bathroom amenities". Or you could add more attributes to the house like the number of floors, square footage, etc. Please note this pattern represents a kind of ontology graph which can be represented in different ways depending on the particular ontological language or framework you are using (e.g., OWL, RDF, etc.).

Sure, here is a basic pattern for representing a house using ontology in Turtle/RDF format:```@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .ex:House a owl:Class ;    rdfs:label "House"@en ;    rdfs:comment "Represents a house in the ontology"@en .ex:hasAddress a owl:ObjectProperty ;    rdfs:label "has address"@en ;    rdfs:comment "The address of the house"@en ;    rdfs:domain ex:House ;    rdf:range ex:Address .ex:Address a owl:Class ;    rdfs:label "Address"@en ;    rdfs:comment "Represents an address in the ontology"@en .```This RDF/Turtle defines a `House` class along with an `Address` class, and also describes the `hasAddress` property that shows the address of a house. An instance of a `House` has an address which is an instance of the `Address` class.
Are you able to design a simple framework within an ontology to embody {noun}?		Are you able to design a simple framework within an ontology to embody House?	Absolutely! Designing a simple framework within an ontology to embody a house involves defining the concept of a house in terms of other concepts. Here's a simple example:1. **Class:** House   - This is the main concept or entity, representing a house.2. **Properties/Characteristics:**   - *Size:* This could be an integer property to represent the square footage of the house.   - *Location:* This could be a string property to represent the address or city of the house.   - *House Type:* This could be a string property to represent the type of the house (e.g., bungalow, duplex, apartment, etc.)   - *Color:* This might be a string property to represent the color of the house.3. **Relations:**   - *HasRooms:* This is a relationship between House and another class, Room. A house has one or more rooms.   - *OwnedBy:* This is a relationship between House and another class, Person. A house is owned by a person.4. **Subclasses:**   - Subclasses of the "House" class could include specific types of houses, Like "Bungalow", "Duplex", "Apartment" etc.5. **Instances:**   - These are specific examples of houses that would fit into the class "House", with properties and characteristics of their own. For example, a specific bungalow located at a particular address.This is a very simplified example and a real ontology would be much more comprehensive, with a larger set of classes, properties, relations and constraints.

Can you establish a basic structure for encapsulating {noun} in ontology terms?		Can you establish a basic structure for encapsulating House in ontology terms?	Sure, here's a basic structure in ontology terms for a house:1. Class: House2. Sub-classes: Apartment, Bungalow, Villa, Townhouse, etc.3. Properties or Relations:    - HasOwner (a relation to another class, Person)   - HasAddress (a datatype property that would hold a string)   - HasRooms (an integer representing the count of rooms)   - HasBathrooms (an integer representing the count of bathrooms)   - IsLocatedIn (a relation to another class, Location/City)4. Data-type Attributes (specific inherent qualities such as):    - ConstructionYear (could be represented as a date or integer)   - SquareFootage (could be represented as an integer)    - PatioAvailable (could be represented as a boolean)   - Price (could be represented as a decimal)  5. Individual: Each specific house would be an individual within this class. For example, "Blue_Bungalow_In_Scottsdale_With_3Rooms" could be an individual. Its HasOwner property could be linked to a Person individual, its HasAddress property could contain the string of the house's address, it could have three rooms and two bathrooms, it could have PatioAvailable as 'true', its construction year could be 2001, and so on.Remember that this structure can be further extended according to specific needs. In this structure, other aspects such as color, interior details, or exterior details of the house are omitted but they could be included if needed.

Would you create a straightforward ontology model to capture {noun}?		Would you create a straightforward ontology model to capture House?	Ontology models are a set of concepts and categories that show properties and the relations between them. They are used to reason about the entities within a specific domain.Here's a basic ontology model for a House:1. Entity: House - Properties: Address, Size (Square Footage), Type (i.e., bungalow, apartment, duplex), Sale Price, Number of Rooms, Year Built, Architectural Style, Color.2. Sub-entities: Rooms - Living Room - Bedroom - Kitchen - Bathroom - Garage3. Relations:  - A House 'has' Rooms - A Room 'is part of' a House - A House 'is located at' an Address4. Each Sub-entity (Room) can have properties: - Room Size (Square Footage) - Room Type (i.e., master bedroom, guest bedroom, kitchen, living room, etc.) - Room Features (i.e., fireplace, closet, windows, etc.)5. Relations between entities and sub-entities: - A Room 'belongs to' a House - A House 'contains' Rooms - A Room 'has' FeaturesThis basic ontology model captures the essential aspects of a house and includes some potential characteristics and relationships. However, you could further refine and expand upon this model based on the specific needs of your project or application.

This is just a simple and basic ontology, which can be expanded on for more complex uses.
Could you devise a simple scheme for representing {noun} within an ontology context?		Could you devise a simple scheme for representing House within an ontology context?	Sure, following is a simple representation of a House within an ontology context. 1. Concept: House    - Description: A building for human habitation.2. Properties/Attributes of House:   - HouseID: Unique identifier for each house.   - HouseName: Name of the House.   - Address: The location of the House.   - NumberOfRooms: The number of rooms in the House.   - HouseType: Type of the House (e.g., Bungalow, Apartment, Villa, etc.)   - BuiltYear: The year when the House was built.   - HouseSize: The size of the House in square feet.3. Relationships:   - hasOwner: The owner of the House.   - isLocatedIn: The area or the city where the House is located.   - hasNeighbor: The neighboring houses around the particular House.   4. Functions/Methods:   - getHouseDetails: Fetch details about the House.   - updateHouseDetails: Update details about the House.   - fetchOwnerDetails: Fetch details about the owner of the House.    This representation is a basic one and highly flexible. You can add further attributes, relationships or functions depending upon its usage in your greater ontology scheme. For example, if your ontology build is focusing on real estate, you might want to add attributes like house price, real estate agent, etc. If your ontology is for energy consumption studies, you might add attributes like energy rating, insulation type, etc.

The comments and labels for each entity are also provided appropriately.
Could you develop a basic design pattern for representing the following in an ontology: {noun}		Could you develop a basic design pattern for representing the following in an ontology: House	Sure, a basic design pattern for representing a House in an ontology can be divided into various classes and properties. Classes:1. `House` 2. `Room` 3. `Floor` 4. `Furniture` 5. `Location`Properties:1. `hasRooms` (Property of House relating to Rooms)2. `hasFloors` (Property of House relating to Floors)3. `hasFurniture` (Property of Room relating to Furniture)4. `hasLocation` (Property of House relating to Location)Individuals of class `House` can have properties like `hasRooms`, `hasFloors`, and `hasLocation` which will represent the number of rooms the house has, the number of floors, and the location of the house respectively. Individuals of class `Room` can have properties like `hasFurniture` which will represent the type of furniture in the room (a subset of the `Furniture` class).So if you take an example:Individual:- `House1` which is an instance of class `House`, can have properties like `hasRooms=3`, `hasFloors=2`, and `hasLocation="New York"`.- `Room1` which is an instance of class `Room` associated with `House1`, can have properties like `hasFurniture="Bed"`.This pattern helps in providing semantic and contextual information about a house and its associated entities.

Yes/No.    - dateBuilt: The date the house was built.    - architecturalStyle: The style of architecture of the house.    - color: The prominent color of the house.    3. Relationships:    - isLocatedIn: relation to a City or a Suburb.    - isOwnedBy: relation to an Owner.    - isNeighboredBy: relation to other Houses.    - inspectedBy: relation to an Inspector.4. Instances:     - House123, Villa456, Bungalow789, etc.This is a relatively simplistic ontology for a house and can be expanded upon depending on the specific use case. For example, the ontology can be expanded to include information about floor plans, the history of ownership, tax data, etc. It can also take into account relationships to other entities like Real Estate Agencies, Property Managers, and more.

Are you able to design a simple framework within an ontology to describe the following: House Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Sure, here's a simple ontology for a House described in Turtle format:```ttl@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .@prefix : <http://example.org/house#> .:House a rdfs:Class ;    rdfs:label "House"@en ;    rdfs:comment "A building for human habitation, especially one that is lived in by a family or small group of people."@en .:hasAddress a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain :House ;    rdfs:range xsd:string ;    rdfs:label "has address"@en ;    rdfs:comment "The address at which the house is located."@en .:hasNumberOfRooms a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain :House ;    rdfs:range xsd:integer ;    rdfs:label "has number of rooms"@en ;    rdfs:comment "The number of rooms in the house."@en .:hasArea a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain :House ;    rdfs:range xsd:float ;    rdfs:label "has area"@en ;    rdfs:comment "The total surface area of the house, including all floors and outdoor spaces (if any). Usually measured in square meters or square feet."@en .```This defines a class named House with properties 'hasAddress', 'hasNumberOfRooms', and 'hasArea'. Each property has a domain (in this case, the class House), a range (such as xsd:string, xsd:integer or xsd:float for the three properties defined), a label, and a comment.
Could you craft a minimalist design pattern to illustrate the following within an ontology: {noun}		Could you craft a minimalist design pattern to illustrate the following within an ontology: House	Sure! Here's a well-structured, minimalist ontology design for a "House".1. **Concept:** House2. **Sub-concepts or Properties:**   - Location   - Size (Can be subdivided into rooms, floors, etc.)   - Type (single-family, multi-family, townhome, etc)   - ArchitectureStyle (Victorian, modern, farmhouse, etc.)   - BuildYear   - Colour   - Material (wood, brick, concrete, etc.)3. **Related concepts (relationship in parentheses):**    - Owner (owned by)    - Inhabitant (inhabited by)4. **Instances:**    - VillaXYZ (a specific house)    - DuplexABC (another specific house)Remember that an ontology is not just a taxonomy (concept hierarchy), but also defines relationships among the concepts. This is a very simple ontology for a house, but it could be extended massively based on the needs of the project.

Can you establish a basic structure for encapsulating the following in ontology terms: {noun}		Can you establish a basic structure for encapsulating the following in ontology terms: House	Sure, here's a basic structure that encapsulates the term "House" in an ontology:1. Class: House   - Sub-classes: Single-family house, Duplex, Townhouse, Apartment, Condominium, Mobile home, etc.   2. Attributes (data properties):    - Address    - Number of rooms   - Square footage   - Property value   - Year built   - Type of building material3. Relationships (object properties):   - Is located in: City, State, Country   - Is part of: Neighborhood, Community   - Is owned by: Person, Corporation   - Has: Rooms (Bedroom, Bathroom, Kitchen etc.), Garage, Backyard, etc.4. Instances:   - Every specific instances of a house in the real world like "John's house at 123 St, Colorado", "The famous white house in Washington D.C.", etc. Remember, how deep you would want your ontology to be is entirely dependent on your requirements. If you want to go deeper, you can add more subclasses or properties. For example, Bedroom could be a subclass of House with properties like number of beds, type of beds, has attached bathroom, etc.

Would you create a straightforward ontology model to capture the following: {noun}		Would you create a straightforward ontology model to capture the following: House	Sure, here's a very basic and simplified Ontological model to represent a House:1. House (Super class)    - Property: Address       - Type: String    - Property: Size       - Type: Float (in square feet)    - Property: DateBuilt       - Type: Date    - Property: Type       - Type: String      Child classes of House:      2. Rooms       - Property: RoomType         - Type: String       - Property: RoomSize         - Type: Float       - Property: HasWindow         - Type: Boolean          3. Kitchen       - Property: KitchenType         - Type: String       - Property: HasDishwasher         - Type: Boolean          4. Bathroom       - Property: BathroomType         - Type: String       - Property: HasBathtub         - Type: Boolean        5. Garage       - Property: GarageSize         - Type: Float       - Property: HasToolset         - Type: BooleanThis ontology describes a house with basic properties. The child classes Rooms, Kitchen, Bathroom, and Garage further provide details on specific parts of the house. Each child class has its own set of properties which further define the characteristics of that part of the house.Please note that this is just a simplified version and a real ontological model for a house could be much more complex depending upon the level of detail one wants to capture.

Could you devise a simple scheme for representing the following within an ontology context: {noun}		Could you devise a simple scheme for representing the following within an ontology context: House	Sure, here's a simple ontology scheme to represent a "House". Each entity would be a class within the ontology, each attribute would be a property, and each linkage would define a relationship between entities. 1. Entity: House    Attributes: address, year_built, type (e.g., detached, semi-detached, etc.), square_footage, color, price2. Entity: Room    Attributes: room_type (e.g., bedroom, bathroom, etc.), room_size, flooring_type    Linkage: is_part_in House3. Entity: Owner    Attributes: first_name, last_name, phone_number    Linkage: owns House4. Entity: Location    Attributes: city, state, country, ZIP_code, neighborhood    Linkage: is_located_in HouseWith this structure, queries can be made within the ontology, such as retrieving the size of a specific type of room in a house, identifying the owner of a house, or finding the city where a house is located. This is a basic ontology and can be developed further depending on what needs to be represented.

A house class is defined along with two properties 'hasRooms' and 'hasArea'. We also define 'Room' and 'Area' classes. An instance of a house is also defined (aHouse) with one room (aRoom) and an area (anArea).
