Develop an ontology dedicated to {noun}.		Develop an ontology dedicated to Issue.	Ontology is a way to represent information or a model for describing the world, which includes definition of classes, properties of the classes, and relationships between those classes. Here is an attempt at creating an ontology specifically dedicated to "Issues":**Classes:**1. Issue2. Issue Type3. Issue Status4. Issue Priority5. Issue Owner6. Issue Assignee7. Issue Comment8. Issue Attachment9. Issue Project10. Issue Environment11. Issue Resolution12. Issue Due Date13. Issue Creation Date14. Issue Update Date**Properties of Classes:**1. Issue - Description, Issue ID, URL, Issue Key2. Issue Type - Bug, Improvement, New Feature, Task, Sub-task, Story, Epic3. Issue Status - Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed, Reopened4. Issue Priority - Blocker, Critical, Major, Minor, Trivial5. Issue Owner - Email, Name, Role6. Issue Assignee - Email, Name, Role7. Issue Comment - Comment Text, Issue Comment Time, Comment User8. Issue Attachment - Attachment File9. Issue Project - Project Name, Project ID, Project Key10. Issue Environment - Environment Name11. Issue Resolution - Fixed, Wonâ€™t Fix, Duplicate, Incomplete, Cannot Reproduce, Done12. Issue Due Date - Due Date13. Issue Creation Date - Creation Date14. Issue Update Date - Last Update Date**Relationships between the Classes:**1. Issue has an Issue type2. Issue has an Issue status3. Issue has an Issue priority4. Issue has an Issue owner5. Issue has an Issue assignee6. Issue contains Issue comments7. Issue has Issue attachments8. Issue belongs to a Issue project9. Issue occurs in an Issue environment10. Issue has an Issue resolution11. Issue has an Issue due date12. Issue has an Issue creation date13. Issue has an Issue update dateThis ontology can be further complex or simplified depending on the requirements and context. The attributes can vary according to what kind of issue (software bug, customer complaint, etc.) is being modeled.

Design an ontology to encompass the following: {noun}.		Design an ontology to encompass the following: Issue.	An ontology for the concept of "Issue" involves several elements. Here is a basic structure:CARDS (Superclass)1. Issue (Main Class)       - Types of Issues (Subclass)            * Social Issues            * Political Issues            * Environmental Issues            * Personal Issues            * Technical Issues       - Issue Description (Attribute)            * Brief Description            * Detailed Description       - Issue Status (Attribute)            * Open            * Closed            * On Hold       - Issue Severity (Attribute)            * Low            * Moderate            * High       - Relevant Parties (Subclass)            * Stakeholders            * Concerned Groups       - Solutions (Subclass)            * Proposed            * Implemented            * Failed Why this structure?This ontology is designed to encompass all the potential elements related to an "issue". It covers its types, a detailed or brief description, its status in context (whether it's opened, closed, or on hold), the severity and the parties involved which could be stakeholders or any concerned groups. The last aspect presents the solutions that can either be proposed, implemented or have failed. This makes the ontology applicable in many contexts, such as in project management, policy making, or business strategy etc. which would be dealing with various types of issues.

Could you develop a basic design pattern for representing {noun} in an ontology?		Could you develop a basic design pattern for representing Issue in an ontology?	Sure, here is a basic pattern for representing an "Issue" in an ontology:1. **Issue:** This will be the key class in the ontology. An Issue could be understood as a matter of concern or problem that needs to be resolved in a particular context.     *Properties:*     - Title: A short, descriptive name of the issue.    - Description: A longer, detailed description of the issue.    - Status: Indicates the current status of the issue (e.g., open, closed, pending)    - Priority: Indicates the severity or importance of the issue (e.g., low, medium, high)    - Type: Describes the type of the issue (e.g., bug, feature request, task, etc.)  2. **Issue Owner:** This class represents the individual or group responsible for the issue.       *Properties:*     - OwnerName: Defines the name of the owner.    - Contact: Defines contact information for the owner.  3. **Issue Tracker:** This class represents the instrument or system through which the issue is being tracked and managed.   *Properties:*    - TrackerName: Defines the name of the tracking system.    - URL: Defines the URL where the tracker is accessible.  4. **Issue Comment:** This class represents the comments or discussions associated to the issue.   *Properties:*    - CommentContent: The content of the comment.    - CommentDate: The date and time when the comment was posted.Relationships:- **Issue-hasOwner-IssueOwner:** This relationship connects an Issue to its owner. - **Issue-trackedBy-IssueTracker:** This relationship connects an Issue to its tracking system.- **Issue-hasComment-IssueComment:** This relationship connects an Issue to its relevant comments.This is a simple ontology design pattern for representing "Issue". Depending on the requirements and complexity of the system, more layers of classes and relationships could be further added.

Is it possible for you to create a straightforward pattern to depict {noun} ontologically?		Is it possible for you to create a straightforward pattern to depict Issue ontologically?	As an AI, I can provide the following straightforward pattern to depict the concept "Issue" ontologically:1. **Concept:** Issue - This serves as the primary subject or the entity of the ontology. 2. **Properties/Attributes:** An issue might have properties like `Date Raised`, `Raised by`, `Status`, `Description`, `Priority`, `Category`, etc. These define the characteristics of an issue.3. **Relationships:** An issue might have relationships with other entities such as `Assigned to` (a person or team), `Related to` (a project or another issue), `Caused by` (a particular event or root cause), etc. These relationships provide context and connections to other relevant entities within the ontology. 4. **Actions/Methods:** These are operations related to the issue. They can include `Raise`, `Assign`, `Resolve`, `Close`, `Reopen`, etc. Remember that ontologies vary greatly depending on the exact requirements and the specific domain of discourse. The above template is just for a general understanding and simplification.

Is it possible for you to create a straightforward pattern to depict Issue ontologically? Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Yes, it is absolutely possible to depict "Issue" in a straightforward pattern ontologically. Here's an example in Turtle/RDF format:```ttl@prefix : <http://example.org/> .:Issue a rdfs:Class .:issue1 a :Issue ;    rdfs:label "Issue 1" ;    :description "Description of the issue" ;    :status "Open" .:issue2 a :Issue ;    rdfs:label "Issue 2" ;    :description "Description of the issue" ;    :status "Closed" .```In this pattern, `Issue` is depicted as a class with instances like `issue1`, `issue2` etc. Each instance has properties such as `rdfs:label`, `description`, and `status`. Please replace `<http://example.org/>` with your actual namespace. Also, properties `:description` and `:status` are just placeholders, you should define them according to your ontology requirements.
Can you formulate a simple ontology pattern that captures the essence of {noun}?		Can you formulate a simple ontology pattern that captures the essence of Issue?

Can you formulate a simple ontology pattern that captures the essence of Issue? Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Sure, in the simplest sense, an issue can be represented by its title, description and status. It can also be linked to a person, who might be responsible for it. Let's represent this in Turtle / RDF format.```turtle@prefix : <http://example.com/> .:Issue a rdfs:Class .:hasTitle a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain :Issue ;    rdfs:range xsd:string .:hasDescription a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain :Issue ;    rdfs:range xsd:string .:hasStatus a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain :Issue ;    rdfs:range :Status .:Status a rdfs:Class .:Open a :Status .:Closed a :Status .:assignedTo a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain :Issue ;    rdfs:range :Person .:Person a rdfs:Class .```In this representation, an issue has three properties by which it's characterized: its title, its description and its status. The status can be either open or closed. A Person is assigned to the issue. This pattern allows handling issues and their status, description, title and responsible person. This is a common pattern for issues that one might find for instance in a bug tracking system.
Would you be able to generate a basic pattern for {noun}'s ontological representation?		Would you be able to generate a basic pattern for Issue's ontological representation?	Yes, here's a basic pattern for representing an Issue in terms of ontology:- Class: Issue  - Subclass: SocialIssue, TechnicalIssue, PoliticalIssue, etc.- Data Properties(Attributes): IssueID, IssueName, IssueDescription, IssueDate, IssueStatus, etc.- Object Properties(Relationships): IssuedBy, IssueOwnedBy, IssuerelatedTo, IssueCauses, IssueResolution, etc.- Individuals: Each specific instance of an issue can be considered as an individual in this ontology.All these elements of ontology contribute towards forming a vision about the issue from different perspectives at different levels of granularity.Note: This could adapt based on the specific context you're working in. More granular or different fields may be necessary depending on your specific use case. It's also helpful to tie it together with other parts of your ontology (e.g., who or what the issue relates to, what objects and actions might be associated with resolving it, etc.).

This is a simple model and may need to be expanded or modified to suit more complex requirements.
Are you able to design a simple framework within an ontology to embody {noun}?		Are you able to design a simple framework within an ontology to embody Issue?	Yes, it's possible to design such framework. Here is a basic, simplified example:1. Issue (Main Concept):    a) Issue Identifier: Every issue will have a unique identifier used to differentiate between different issues reported or identified.    b) Issue Description: Details describing the nature of the issue, the area involved, and the impact it has or may have.        c) Issue Type: Categorizes the issue according to what it pertains to. For instance, technical, administrative, operational, etc.    d) Issue Status: Keeps track of the status of the issue. For instance, open, closed, pending, resolved, etc.    e) Issue Priority: Defines the criticalness or importance of the issue. For example, high, medium, low.    f) Reported By: Information regarding who or which process identified and reported the issue.     g) Assigned To: Resource(s) to whom this issue is currently assigned for resolution.    h) Date/Time Reported: When the issue was first reported.    i) Date/Time Resolved: When the issue was resolved.    j) Resolution Comments: Details on how the issue was resolved, potential root causes, and preventive suggestions.This represents a very basic framework and can be made more complex by adding additional properties or creating new entities to further represent relationships. For example, Relationships could be established with "Project," "Department," "Solutions" etc. It's also important to note that such an ontology is used to model knowledge and should be adapted to the specific needs of each scenario where it's applied.

Could you craft a minimalist design pattern to illustrate {noun} within an ontology?		Could you craft a minimalist design pattern to illustrate Issue within an ontology?	Design patterns are widely used in Object-Oriented Programming. In an ontology, the concepts and relationships could be seen as equivalent to objects and methods. So we can conceptualize a pattern for the concept of "Issue" as follows:1. First, define the class "Issue." This can be the central piece in your ontology structure.```textClass: Issue```2. Next, define sub-classes if needed. For things like "SoftwareIssue", "HardwareIssue", "BusinessIssue" that further details the type of issue.```textSubClassOf:     SoftwareIssue,     HardwareIssue,     BusinessIssue```3. Define some properties, actions or characteristics that are associated with an "Issue". This could include properties such as: "issueID", "issueName", "issueSeverity", "issueStatus".```textObjectProperties:     issueID,     issueName,     issueSeverity,     issueStatus```4. Finally, you can also specify relationships between this "Issue" class and other classes in your ontology.```textRelationships:     Issue isRelatedTo Person(Employee, Manager, etc.),     Issue isPartOf Project,     Issue hasSolution Solution```So, this is how a basic structure of "Issue" can be designed in an ontology with a minimalist design pattern.

Could you craft a minimalist design pattern to illustrate Issue within an ontology? Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Sure, here's a simple illustration of the Issue within an ontology:```turtle@prefix : <http://example.org/issue#> .@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .:Issue rdf:type rdf:Class .:hasIssue rdf:type rdf:Property ;    rdf:domain :Entity ;    rdf:range :Issue .:IssueDescription rdf:type rdf:Property ;    rdf:domain :Issue ;    rdf:range :Text .:Entity01 :hasIssue :Issue01 .:Issue01 :IssueDescription "Issue description here" .```In this representation, `Issue` is a class that represents a certain problem, error, or situation that needs to be addressed. `Entity` could be any entity that could have an issue (a project, a person, a device, etc.). `hasIssue` is a property that links an `Entity` with an `Issue`, and `IssueDescription` provides a textual description of the issue. The last two triples are instances of an `Entity` having an `Issue` with a specific description.
Can you establish a basic structure for encapsulating {noun} in ontology terms?		Can you establish a basic structure for encapsulating Issue in ontology terms?	Absolutely, here's a basic structure to represent an "Issue" within the disciplines of ontology:1. `Class`: Issue    In the ontology hierarchy, an "Issue" can be defined as a class, which represents a concept or a type.2. `Subclasses` of Issue:    Depending on what context this ontology is built for, there could be several subclasses of issue, such as TechnicalIssue, SocialIssue, MedicalIssue, etc. Each subclass has more specific characteristics but also shares the properties of the main Issue class.3. `Instances` of Issue:   It can be specific issues like climate change (instance of SocialIssue), network failure (instance of TechnicalIssue), etc.4. `Properties` of Issue:    These could include properties like hasDescription: giving a detailed explanation of the issue, hasSeverity: representing the severity of the issue, reportedBy: the person or entity who reported the issue, reportedOn: the date/time when this issue was reported, etc.5. `Relationships`:    It could connect the "Issue" class to other classes and define the relation. For example, Issues can be linked to 'Solutions' through a 'hasSolution' relationship, or to 'People' who report/concern about them via a 'reportedBy' or 'concerns' relationship.Remember, the specific structure and terms would likely be more specific and complex based on the context and needs of the ontology's usage.

Would you create a straightforward ontology model to capture {noun}?		Would you create a straightforward ontology model to capture Issue?	Sure! An ontology model for the concept "Issue" could look like this:1. Issue --> Has a unique identifier, issue title, status, description, creation date, resolution date (if applicable), person who reported, assigned to, related project or system, priority, type of issue (bug, task, enhancement, etc).2. Status --> Possible values can be Open, In Process, Resolved, Closed, On Hold etc.3. Person --> Can have attributes like name, contact information, role in project or organization.4. Project/system --> Relevant information about the project or system with which the issue is associated.5. Priority --> Indicate criticality of issue, e.g., Low, Medium, High, Urgent.6. Type --> Category or type of issue. Examples include bug, task, feature request, improvement, help needed etc.Relationships between these classes can be also defined such as:- An "Issue" is reported by a "Person"- An "Issue" is assigned to a "Person"- An "Issue" belongs to a certain "Project/system"- An "Issue" has a specific "Priority" - An "Issue" is of a specific "Type"This model would allow for the capture of a wide range of information regarding an issue, making it easier to manage and resolve. Keep in mind, modifications or enhancements may be needed depending on the specific use case.

Could you devise a simple scheme for representing {noun} within an ontology context?		Could you devise a simple scheme for representing Issue within an ontology context?	Sure, here's a simple, general scheme for representing an "Issue" within an ontology context (e.g., for a problem tracking or project management system):- `Issue`: Main entity that represents the problem or topic.    - `IssueID`: Unique identifier for the issue.    - `Title`: A brief, descriptive title for the issue.    - `Description`: A more elaborate explanation of what the problem or issue entails.    - `CreatedDate`: The date when the issue was created.    - `CreatedBy`: The entity/user who created the issue.    - `Priority`: How important or urgent the issue is.- `Status`: Describes the current state of the issue. It could be New, In Progress, Resolved, Closed, etc.    - `StatusID`: Unique identifier for the status type.    - `StatusName`: Name of the status.    - `IssueType`: Classification of the issue. It could be Bug, Task, Epic, etc.    - `TypeID`: Unique identifier for the issue type.    - `TypeName`: Name of the issue type.- `Comment`: Some notes or updates on the issue.    - `CommentID`: Unique identifier for the comment.    - `Content`: The actual text of the comment.    - `PostedBy`: The entity/user who posted the comment.    - `PostedDate`: The date when the comment was posted.- `AssignedTo`: The entity/user to whom the issue is currently assigned.This is a pretty simple model and can be easily extended or modified based on the specific needs of your system.

Concept: Issue2. Properties of Issue:    - Issue ID: a unique identifier (Data type: string or number) for each issue.    - Description: a description of the issue (Data type: string or text).    - Status: the current status of the issue, e.g., open, in-progress, resolved (Data type: string).3. Relations to Other Concepts:    - AssignedTo: who the issue is currently assigned to (Connected concept: Person or User).    - ReportedBy: who reported the issue (Connected concept: Person or User).    - BelongsTo: which project or area the issue belongs to (Connected concept: Project or Component).    - HasPriority: the priority level of the issue, e.g., low, medium, high (Connected concept: Priority).4. Subclasses of Issue:    - Bug: a type of issue that represents an error, flaw or fault.    - FeatureRequest: a type of issue that represents a request for new functionality.    - Task: a type of issue that represents a piece of work to be done or undertaken.    5. Instances of Issue:    - Issue1, Issue2, Issue3, ...Remember, the design of your ontology heavily depends on what you're trying to achieve and the domain you're working in, so adapt this basic pattern to your needs.

Sure, here is a simple ontology pattern in Turtle/RDF that captures the essence of an "Issue":```ttl@prefix : <http://example.com/ontology#> .@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .:Issue a rdfs:Class ;    rdfs:label "Issue"@en ;    rdfs:comment "A matter of concern or a problem"@en .    :hasIssue a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:label "has issue"@en ;    rdfs:comment "Property for associating something with an issue"@en ;    rdfs:domain :Something ;    rdfs:range :Issue .    :isIssueOf a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:label "is issue of"@en ;    rdfs:comment "Property for associating an issue with something"@en ;    rdfs:domain :Issue ;    rdfs:range :Something .:Something a rdfs:Class ;    rdfs:label "Something"@en ;    rdfs:comment "A thing, entity or being that can have an issue"@en .```This ontology simply defines an Issue class and a Something class. An "Issue" is understood as a matter of concern or a problem. The relations "hasIssue" and "isIssueOf" link Issue and Something together, so that you can say something has an issue, or an issue is of something. This is a very basic ontology and needs to be expanded and adapted to your specific needs.
Would you be able to generate a basic pattern for the following's ontological representation: {noun}		Would you be able to generate a basic pattern for the following's ontological representation: Issue	Sure, a basic ontological representation pattern for the term "Issue" might look like this:1. Issue   - IssueID (Unique identification for the particular issue)   - IssueType (The type or category of the issue e.g., bug, feature request, problem)   - IssueDescription (A brief description of the issue)   - IssueStatus (The current status of the issue e.g., open, closed, in-progress)   - IssuePriority (Level of importance or urgency of the issue)   - IssueCreationDate (Date when the issue was first identified or logged)   - IssueResolutionDate (The date when the issue was resolved)   - AssignedTo (The person or team responsible for dealing with the issue)   - RaisedBy (The person or customer who reported the issue)   - IssueComments (Any comments or additional information about the issue)   This is just a basic pattern, the actual ontological model of "Issue" can be more intricate depending upon the specific domain or context.

In this case, we're representing each issue as an RDF resource of type `ex:Issue`, with attributes for title, description, status, and the user it's assigned to. The URI prefixes `ex:` and `rdf:` stand for placeholder base URIs which you'll replace with the actual URIs of your base data and the RDF standard respectively. Note that `a` is a shorthand for `rdf:type` in Turtle syntax, and it is used to specify the class or type of the resources.

Description: Detailed explanation of the issue.        iii. Category: The type of the issue e.g. Social, Technical, Environmental, etc.        iv. Status: The current state of the issue e.g. Open, closed, pending, etc.        v. Resolution: The solution or fix to the issue (if applicable).        vi. Impact: The potential or actual effects of the issue.        vii. Stakeholder: The person or group who has an interest in the issue.2. Subclasses/Types of Issue:    a. Technical Issue        i. RelatedDevices: The tools or machines involved or affected by the technical issue.        ii. ErrorCodes: A system's means of identifying specific errors or issues.    b. Social Issue        i. PopulationAffected: Identifying the demographic or group of people affected by the social issue.        ii. Causes: The events or factors contributing to the social issue.        iii. Solutions: Proposed or implemented resolutions to the social issue.    c. Environmental Issue        i. Location: Where the environmental issue is primarily taking place.        ii. Causes: The events or factors leading to the environmental issue.        iii. ImpactonFloraandFauna: How the environmental issue is affecting local wildlife and vegetation.3. Ontology Relations:    a. "Issue" can have "Subissue": A smaller or more specific problem connected to the larger issue.    b. "Issue" is affected by 'Cause': An event, action, or condition that contributes to an issue.    c. "Issue" can be solved with 'Solution': The method or plan to address and resolve an issue. Of course, for a more complex model, more classes and subclasses might be needed. But this provides a basic structure for thinking about an "Issue" within an ontology.

Are you able to design a simple framework within an ontology to describe the following: Issue Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Sure, here is an example simple framework expressed in valid Turtle/RDF format to describe an "Issue". This is of course a very generic framework and each "Issue" has properties such as identifier, title, description and status. It could also be linked with a person acting as creator:```turtle@prefix ex: <http://example.com/> .@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .# Define the class of Issueex:Issue rdf:type rdfs:Class .# Define properties related to Issueex:identifier rdf:type rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain ex:Issue ;    rdfs:range xsd:string .ex:title rdf:type rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain ex:Issue ;    rdfs:range xsd:string .    ex:description rdf:type rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain ex:Issue ;    rdfs:range xsd:string . ex:status rdf:type rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain ex:Issue ;    rdfs:range xsd:string .# Define a class for Person ex:Person rdf:type rdfs:Class .# Define property creator which links Issue to Personex:creator rdf:type rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain ex:Issue ;    rdfs:range ex:Person .```This Turtle representation asserts that "identifier", "title", "description", and "status" are properties with an "Issue" as the domain and a literal value as range. "creator" is a property that links an "Issue" with a "Person" acting as the creator. This is a representative framework and will depend on specific case by case basis.
Could you craft a minimalist design pattern to illustrate the following within an ontology: {noun}		Could you craft a minimalist design pattern to illustrate the following within an ontology: Issue	Designing an ontology design pattern for "Issue" can be an interesting task. Here is a minimalist, conceptual design pattern:1. Class: Issue   Properties:    - hasTitle (datatype property)   - hasDescription (datatype property)   - hasDateCreated (datatype property)   - hasStatus (datatype property)   - isRelatedTo (object property, domain: Issue, range: Issue)2. Class: User   Properties:   - created (object property, domain: User, range: Issue)   - hasSolved (object property, domain: User, range: Issue)3. Class: Tag   Properties:   - isTaggedIn (object property, domain: Tag, range: Issue)This is a basic pattern where an "Issue" can have a title, a description, a creation date, a status (such as open, closed, in progress, etc.), and can be related to other issues. Users are those who create and/or solve issues. A tagging system is also included where each issue can have one or more tags for easy categorization and searchability. Naturally, the design pattern can be expanded and modified according to the specific requirements of the application or system.

Could you craft a minimalist design pattern to illustrate the following within an ontology: Issue Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Sure, here's a simple example of how an Issue might be represented within an ontology in Turtle/RDF format:```turtle@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix : <http://www.example.com/issue#> .:Issue a rdf:Class .:hasTitle a rdf:Property ;    rdf:domain :Issue ;    rdf:range rdf:Literal .:hasDescription a rdf:Property ;    rdf:domain :Issue ;    rdf:range rdf:Literal .```In this example, "Issue" is a class defined in the ontology. The "hasTitle" and "hasDescription" properties have "Issue" as their domain, meaning they are properties that instances of the Issue class can have. They have "Literal" as their range, meaning the values of these properties can be any literal value (like text strings).

Could you devise a simple scheme for representing the following within an ontology context: {noun}		Could you devise a simple scheme for representing the following within an ontology context: Issue	Ontologies are data models that represent entities and the relationships between them. They are used to store structured knowledge about a certain domain, in this case "Issue". Here is a simple scheme:- Classes:    - Issue    - Category (Subclass of Issue)   - Priority (Subclass of Issue)   - Status (Subclass of Issue)   - Comment (Subclass of Issue)   - Attachments (Subclass of Issue)  - Relationships (also known as properties or predicates):   - "belongsTo" (connection between Issue and Category)   - "hasPriority" (connection between Issue and Priority)   - "hasStatus" (connection between Issue and Status)   - "hasComment" (connects Issue with Comment)   - "hasAttachment" (connects Issue with Attachments)- Instances (also known as individuals):    - Specific instances of issues, issue categories, priorities, statuses, comments, and attachments will form the content within these classes.  - Attributes (data properties):   - For Issue - IssueID, IssueTitle, IssueDescription, IssueDateCreated    - For Category - CategoryName   - For Priority - PriorityLevel   - For Status - StatusType   - For Comment - CommentText, CommentDate, CommentBy   - For Attachments - AttachmentName, AttachmentType, AttachmentSizeThis is a general and simplified representation which can be modified according to the specific needs of a project or organization.

Could you devise a simple scheme for representing the following within an ontology context: Issue Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Sure, here is a simple schema representing "issue" within an ontology context in Turtle/RDF format:```@prefix : <http://example.org/> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .:issue a rdfs:Class .:hasIssue a rdfs:Property ;    rdfs:domain :Product ;    rdfs:range :issue.:Product a rdfs:Class.``` In the above Turtle representation, there are two classes used i.e., issue and Product. The schema states that a "Product" property "hasIssue" of the class "issue". Please replace `http://example.org/` with your desired URI.
