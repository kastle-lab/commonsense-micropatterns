 The term ""kwg"" could refer to the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz - KWG), but it's not clear how this would relate to a specific entity. If it refers to a specific organization, individual, object, concept, or other real-world entity, we would need further information to create a relevant ontology.In case if ""kwg entity"" refers to a specific legal term under German Banking Act, below is a very basic ontology representation in Turtle/RDF format:
