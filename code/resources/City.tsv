Compose an ontology to represent the following: {noun}.		Compose an ontology to represent the following: City.	Ontology is a representation of concepts or entities and their interrelationships. Here is a basic ontology to represent a city:1. **Entity:** City    - **Attributes:** CityID (unique identifier), CityName, CityPopulation, CityArea, Country, Continent    - **Relationships:** located_in (Country), part_of (Continent)2. **Entity:** Street    - **Attributes:** StreetID (unique identifier), StreetName, City, MapCoordinates    - **Relationships:** part_of (City)3. **Entity:** Building    - **Attributes:** BuildingID (unique identifier), BuildingName, BuildingType (residential, commercial, public, etc.), Street    - **Relationships:** located_on (Street)4. **Entity:** Person    - **Attributes:** PersonID (unique identifier), Name, Age, Occupation, ResidentalBuilding    - **Relationships:** resides_in (Building), works_in (Building)5. **Entity:** Business    - **Attributes:** BusinessID (unique identifier), BusinessName, BusinessType, OperationalHours, CommercialBuilding    - **Relationships:** operates_in (Building)6. **Entity:** Park    - **Attributes:** ParkID (unique identifier), ParkName, ParkArea, MapCoordinates    - **Relationships:** located_in (City)7. **Entity:** Event    - **Attributes:** EventID (unique identifier), EventName, EventDate, EventVenue (could be a park, street, building, etc in the city)    - **Relationships:** takes_place_in (City), held_in (Venue)8. **Entity:** TransportSystem    - **Attributes:** TransportID (unique identifier), TransportType (Bus, Train, Tram, etc.), Route    - **Relationships:** operates_in (City)This is a simplified ontology to represent a city. Cities are complex systems with multiple facets like politics, culture, and economy that can further be added to make the ontology more comprehensive.

Could you develop a basic design pattern for representing {noun} in an ontology?		Could you develop a basic design pattern for representing City in an ontology?	Sure, an Ontology – a system for representing information or knowledge – for representing a City might look something like the following:1. **City**     - Attributes: `City Name`, `Country`, `Population`, `Area`, `Time Zone`    - Relationship:         - `is located in` Relationship with `Country`. (Many-to-one where many cities can belong to one country)        - `has` Relationship with `Landmarks`.(One-to-Many where one city can have many landmarks)    - Instance/Example: 'Paris', 'USA', '2.141 million', '105.4 km²', 'Central European Time Zone'2. **Country**   - Attributes: `Country Name`, `Continent`, `Capital`   - Relationship:      - `is located in` relationship with `Continent`. (Many-to-one where many countries can be in one continent)      - `has` Relationship with `City`. (One-to-many where one country can have many cities)   - Instance/Example: 'USA', 'North America', 'Washington, D.C.'3. **Continent**    - Attributes: `Continent Name`    - Relationship:       - `has` Relationship with `Country`. (One-to-many where one continent can have many countries)    - Instance/Example: 'North America'4. **Landmarks**    - Attributes: `Landmark Name`, `Type`, `Opening Hours`    - Relationship:       - `is part of` Relationship with `City`. (Many-to-one where many landmarks can belong to one city)    - Instance/Example: 'Eiffel Tower', 'Monument', '9:30-23:45'This basic design pattern can be further expanded and enhanced with more concepts, relationships, and attributes as needed. The most critical factor is to ensure all necessary aspects of a city that you want to represent are included.

Could you develop a basic design pattern for representing City in an ontology? Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Sure, here is a basic ontology design pattern for representing a city under the assumption that we are using the namespace "ex:". This example is in Turtle format, which is a syntax for representing semantic data and RDF triples.```turtle@prefix ex: <http://www.example.org/> .@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .ex:City a rdfs:Class ;    rdfs:label "City" ;    rdfs:comment "A large human settlement" .ex:name a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:label "has name" ;    rdfs:comment "Represents the name of the city" ;    rdfs:domain ex:City ;    rdfs:range xsd:string .ex:isLocatedIn a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:label "is located in" ;    rdfs:comment "Represents the country in which the city is located" ;    rdfs:domain ex:City ;    rdfs:range ex:Country .ex:hasPopulation a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:label "has population" ;    rdfs:comment "Represents the population of the city" ;    rdfs:domain ex:City ;    rdfs:range xsd:integer .ex:Country a rdfs:Class ;    rdfs:label "Country" ;    rdfs:comment "A nation with its own government, occupying a particular territory" .```In this pattern, we define city, population, name, and country. A city has a name, a population, and is located in a country. We're also assuming that we have a concept of a country, which is only sketched here very briefly for simplicity.
Is it possible for you to create a straightforward pattern to depict {noun} ontologically?		Is it possible for you to create a straightforward pattern to depict City ontologically?	Yes, I can create a straightforward pattern to represent a City ontologically. The pattern may look like below:City- City name- Country- Population- Area- Characteristics (like geography, culture)   - Geography: Climate, Landmark, etc.   - Culture: Language Spoken, Festivals, etc.- Infrastructure    - Public Services: Hospitals, Schools, etc.   - Transport: Roads, Public Transit, etc.- Government: City council, Mayor, etc.The attributes might be different based on the specifics and requirements of the particular ontology design. This pattern, however, provides a general idea of how a City might be described ontologically.

As an example, we define Paris city with these details. Please note this is a highly simplistic pattern considering only basic aspects of a city. A real-world ontological pattern could be much more complex involving various other properties and relationships.

Would you be able to generate a basic pattern for {noun}'s ontological representation?		Would you be able to generate a basic pattern for City's ontological representation?	Sure, here's a general pattern of ontological representation for a city. Note that this is a very basic pattern and actual ontologies may involve much more detail and complexity.1. `Entity (City)- name: the name of the city`2. `Property - geographical location: the geographical location of the city`3. `Property - population: the population of the city`4. `Property - area: the area of the city`5. `Property - GDP: the GDP of the city`6. `Sub-entity (Landmarks) - list of landmarks: the landmarks in the city`7. `Sub-entity (Infrastructure) - list of infrastructures: the infrastructures in the city, including roads, constructions, parks, hospitals, etc.`8. `Sub-entity (Government) - local government: information about the local government, including mayor, council members, etc.`9. `Sub-entity (Neighborhoods) - list of neighborhoods: the neighborhoods in the city`10. `Relation - neighboring cities: the cities that border the city`The structure could be visualized in a graphical way, showing entities as nodes and properties and relations as edges between them.Remember, a basic principle in ontology is "there is no one correct ontology", and the design often depends on the specific task or problem you want to solve using the ontology.

Would you be able to generate a basic pattern for City's ontological representation? Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Certainly, here is a simple pattern for a city's ontological representation in Turtle/RDF format:```turtle@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .ex:City a rdfs:Class .ex:hasPopulation a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain ex:City ;    rdfs:range rdf:Literal .ex:hasArea a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain ex:City ;    rdfs:range rdf:Literal . ex:hasMayor a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain ex:City ;    rdfs:range ex:Person . ex:isInCountry a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain ex:City ;    rdfs:range ex:Country .# An example of city instanceex:Paris a ex:City ;    ex:hasPopulation "2000000" ;    ex:hasArea "105.4" ;    ex:hasMayor ex:Mairie_De_Paris ;    ex:isInCountry ex:France .# Mayor and Country instances corresponding to the example aboveex:Mairie_De_Paris a ex:Person .ex:France a ex:Country .```In the above pattern, we are defining a class `ex:City` that has properties `ex:hasPopulation`, `ex:hasArea`, `ex:hasMayor`, and `ex:isInCountry`. These properties are assigned to the domain of `ex:City`. Population and area are literals and hence their range are of type `rdf:Literal`. Mayor is a person and country is a different class from city, so they have the range of `ex:Person` and `ex:Country` respectively. At the end, a real example of the city Paris is given that exhibits the usage of these properties.
Are you able to design a simple framework within an ontology to embody {noun}?		Are you able to design a simple framework within an ontology to embody City?	Yes, here's a simple framework representing an ontology for the concept of a "City".1. City:    - City Name    - Country/Region    - Population    - Area (sq km)2. Infrastructure:    - Transportation        - Airport        - Public Transport (Buses, Trains, Taxis)        - Highways    - Utilities        - Water System        - Electricity grid    - Public Spaces        - Parks        - Museums        - Schools        - Hospitals3.

Government/Officials:    - Type of Government    - Mayor/City Leader    - City council members     - Election Process    - City Policies6. Culture/Society:    - Local holidays    - Famous landmarks    - Sports teams    - Festivals and eventsThis list is not exhaustive and some aspects can be expanded upon for more granular detail. A city is a complex entity with many constituent parts and this framework provides a simple representation of those parts.

It also assumes the existence of a Country class, and includes a property to specify what country a city is in.
Could you craft a minimalist design pattern to illustrate {noun} within an ontology?		Could you craft a minimalist design pattern to illustrate City within an ontology?	Sure, here is a minimalist design pattern illustrating a city within an ontology:``` City     - CityID#: Unique identifier     - Name: String     - Country: String     - Population: Integer     - Area: Integer    Methods:     - getCityID()     - getName()     - getCountry()     - getPopulation()     - getArea()     Relations:     - isLocatedIn (Country)     - hasPopulation (Population)     - hasArea (Area)    ```  This example indicates a "City" has properties and methods that are related to it. It's associated with a unique ID, name, a country in which it's located, and some attributes such as population and area. The relations establish the context between the city and its various attributes. This is just a simplistic example and it can become more complex with a hierarchy of other subclasses, each having additional characteristics, and relations depending on the specificity needed in an ontology.

Can you establish a basic structure for encapsulating {noun} in ontology terms?		Can you establish a basic structure for encapsulating City in ontology terms?	Ontology helps to describe the concepts and relationships that are necessary to establish a knowledge structure. Here is a basic ontology to encapsulate a "City":1. Class: City    1.1. SubClass: Capital City    1.2. SubClass: Provincial City    1.3. SubClass: Metropolitan City 2. Object Properties:     2.1. hasResidents: depicting relationship between City and Residents       2.2. isLocatedIn: depicting relationship between City and Country/State/Region      2.3. hasLandmark: depicting relationship between City and Landmark      2.4. hasClimate: depicting relationship between City and Climate      2.5. isGovernedBy: depicting relationship between City and Government   3. Data Properties:   3.1. population: representing the population of the city     3.2. area: representing the geographical area of city      3.3. establishedYear: representing the year when the city was established      3.4. averageTemperature: representing the average temperature of the city4. Individual: Each Individual city acting as instance of Class City.5. Annotation Properties:      5.1. comment: annotation providing a general comment or description of City.      5.2. label: annotation providing a human-readable version of the city.   These are just few of many ontology terms that can capture the concept of a "City". Depending on the depth and complexity of the desired ontology, additional classes, properties, and individuals can be added.

Can you establish a basic structure for encapsulating City in ontology terms? Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Sure, below is a foundational structure for encapsulating a City in ontology terms. Please note that this only provides an elementary structure and can be extended depending on further specifications:```turtle@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .@prefix ex: <http://example.org/stuff/1.0/> .ex:City rdf:type rdfs:Class ;rdfs:label "City" ;rdfs:comment "A city is a large human settlement.

Would you create a straightforward ontology model to capture {noun}?		Would you create a straightforward ontology model to capture City?	Sure, I can create a simple and straightforward ontology model to capture the concept of a "City". Here it is:1. **Class:** City    - **Subclasses:** Capital City, Tourist City, Coastal City, etc.    2. **Properties of City:**    - **Name:** String value    - **Founded:** Integer value (Year)    - **Population:** Integer value     - **Area:** Float value (km²)    - **Country:** String value (May be a link to the Country class in a broader model)    - **Region/State:** String value (May be a link to the Region or State class in a broader model)3. **Relationships:**    - **Is Located In:** Relation to Country Class    - **Is Part of:** Relation to Continent Class    - **Has:** Relation to Landmark Class, Park Class, Person Class (notable people born in/associated with the city), etc.4. **Instances of City:** Instances could include "New York", "London", "Tokyo", "Sydney", etc.This is a very simple example and actual ontology design might be more complex considering factors like different naming conventions across countries or historical changes in city names, countries, etc. Complexities related to geographical hierarchy can also be a part. For example, some large cities might also come under state or province class.

Here is a simple example of how an ontology model could be created to capture the concept of City:```@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .@prefix ex: <http://example.com/> .ex:City a rdf:Class .ex:name a rdf:Property ;    rdf:domain ex:City ;    rdf:range xsd:string .  ex:population a rdf:Property ;    rdf:domain ex:City ;    rdf:range xsd:integer .ex:country a rdf:Property ;    rdf:domain ex:City ;    rdf:range ex:Country .ex:Country a rdf:Class .```This above Turtle representation defines a class `City` with properties `name`, `population`, and `country`. The `name` property is defined with a range of `xsd:string` to allow for city names, while `population` has a range of `xsd:integer` to represent the population of the city. The `country` property is defined with a range of `Country` to indicate in which country a city is located and Country is another class.

The 'hasName' and 'hasPopulation' have literal values (strings or numbers), while 'isInCountry' is linked to another class 'Country'.
Could you devise a simple scheme for representing {noun} within an ontology context?		Could you devise a simple scheme for representing City within an ontology context?	Ontologies help define relationships between entities in a detailed and exhaustive manner. When representing a "City" within an ontology framework, we should consider not only its inherent properties but also its relationships to other entities. Here's a simple scheme for a City:**Entity**: City**Attributes (Properties)**:1. cityName: *string* (Unique identifier for each city)2. country: *string* (The country in which the city is located)3. population: *integer* (The city's demographic attribute)4. area: *integer/float* (The total area covered by the city)5. languageSpoken: *string* (Primary language spoken in the city)6. timeZone: *string* (The official time zone of the city)7. economy: *string* (Overall economic status or description of the city)8. mayor: *string* (Mayor or leader, defining governance)**Relationships (Associations)**:1. isCapitalOf: *country* (If a city is the capital, it has an "isCapitalOf" relationship with the country)2. isConnectedBy: *transportation* (This describes how one city is connected to another—by road, airport, sea, etc.)3. hasLandmark: *landmark* (City to landmark relationship, i.e., Eiffel Tower for Paris)4. hasClimate: *climate* (Climate condition associated with city)In addition to these, many complex relationships, attributes and entities can be included based on the domain and requirements of the ontology. Here's how this would look as a simple text-based ontology in a Turtle-like format:```ttl:city a owl:Class ;     rdfs:label "City" .     :cityName a owl:DatatypeProperty ;     rdfs:range xsd:string .:population a owl:DatatypeProperty ;     rdfs:range xsd:integer .:area a owl:DatatypeProperty ;     rdfs:range xsd:float .     :isCapitalOf a owl:ObjectProperty ;     rdfs:range :Country .     :hasLandmark a owl:ObjectProperty ;     rdfs:range :Landmark .```This is just a very simple example and a real world example would be far more detailed and specific according to the use case.

Both properties are only applicable to instances of the class `City`.
Could you develop a basic design pattern for representing the following in an ontology: {noun}		Could you develop a basic design pattern for representing the following in an ontology: City	Designing an ontology involves defining the classes, properties, individuals, and relationships for a specific domain. For the domain of "City", we can consider a few fundamental categories.Classes:1. City2. Country3. State4. Region5. ContinentProperties:1. hasName2. hasPopulation3. hasArea4. isCapitalOf (specific to City)5. hasLocation6. isInCountry (specific to City)7. isInState (specific to City)8. isInRegion (specific to City)9. isInContinent (specific to City)Individuals:Various instances of each class, such as "New York" for City, and "USA" for Country.Relations:1.

City "isCapitalOf" (Optional, this may only apply for some cities)9. City “hasLocation” (Latitude, Longitude)This is a very high-level and simplistic design pattern and can be further refined or expanded depending on the specific needs and requirements of the project. For example, more classes could involve suburbs, districts, etc. or additional properties or relations could be hasMayor, hasMonuments, etc.

The ontology includes properties to denote the name of the city, the population, and the country that the city is a part of, as well as a Class for Country. This is a very basic design, and additional properties or classes like state, province, etc. may be added according to specific requirements. Furthermore, for avoiding the string literal in languages different than English, the `rdfs:label` and `rdfs:comment` could be used with xml:lang.
Is it possible for you to create a straightforward pattern to depict the following ontologically: {noun}		Is it possible for you to create a straightforward pattern to depict the following ontologically: City	Sure, here is a straightforward pattern that can depict City ontologically:1. City:     - Name (String)    - Country (String)    - Population (Integer)    - Area (Float)    - Coordinates (List of Floats: Latitude and Longitude)For example, a city could be represented as follows:Paris:    - Name: "Paris"    - Country: "France"    - Population: 2,148,271    - Area: 105.4 (in square kilometers)    - Coordinates: [48.8566, 2.3522]In this pattern, each city instance is recognized by a unique name and includes details about its country, population, area, and geographical location (latitude and longitude). Depending on the application, more attributes (like "Mayor", "Elevation", "Density", "Established", etc.) can be added for more detailed information.

Yes, a straightforward pattern depicting that might look something like this in Turtle/RDF format:```turtle@prefix ex: <http://example.com/> .@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .ex:London a ex:City ;    rdfs:label "London" ;    ex:locatedIn ex:UnitedKingdom ;    ex:hasPopulation "8958000"^^xsd:integer .    ex:City a rdfs:Class ;    rdfs:label "City" ;    rdfs:comment "A large human settlement, often a regional centre of commerce and culture." .```In this example, - `ex:` stands for a custom namespace I used to define custom terms.- `a` stands for `rdf:type`, denoting the type/class of a resource.- `ex:City a rdfs:Class` declares `City` to be a class.- `ex:London a ex:City` declares `London` to be an instance of the `City` class.- `rdfs:label` is used to provide a human-readable name for a resource.- `rdfs:comment` is used to provide a human-readable description of a resource.- `ex:locatedIn` denotes a city's country.- `ex:hasPopulation` denotes a city's population, which is an integer.  This example can be easily adjusted to suit the specific needs of different applications. Note that namespaces should be replaced with actual ones used in your application.

The prefixes (rdf, rdfs, ex) are standard in RDF and they denote the namespaces of the terms used. The "a" keyword stands for "is a", marking "City" as an instance of rdf:Class. The rdfs:label and rdfs:comment provide a human-readable name and description for the class respectively. The rdfs:subClassOf relation signifies that City is a subclass of the class Place.

Each of these properties has a `domain` of `City` and a `range` of `string` for the name and `integer` for the population. After they've been created, you can see examples of these properties being used with `Paris` and `London`.
Could you craft a minimalist design pattern to illustrate the following within an ontology: {noun}		Could you craft a minimalist design pattern to illustrate the following within an ontology: City	Designing an ontology involves defining the terms and relationships applicable to the domain of interest. Each term in an ontology typically represents a class, property, or instance. In the context of a "City", a basic ontology might look something like this:1. Class: `City`    * Property: `name`    * Property: `country`    * Property: `population`    * Property: `area_SquareKm`2. Class: `Country`    * Property: `name`    * Property: `continent`3. Relationship: `Located_In`    * Domain: `City`    * Range: `Country`Instance: * `City`    * `name` - "Paris"    * `country` - "France"    * `population` - "2,148,271"    * `area_SquareKm` - "105.4"    * `Country`    * `name` - "France"    * `continent` - "Europe"* `Located_In`    * `Paris` - `France` This basic ontology focuses on the essential characteristics and relationships of a city, including its name, the country it belongs to, its population, and its area in square kilometers. A country, on the other hand, has properties including its name and the continent it's on. The `Located_In` relationship is used to connect a city with the country in which it's found. The instance above illustrates how this ontology could represent the city of Paris in France.

Would you create a straightforward ontology model to capture the following: {noun}	 Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Would you create a straightforward ontology model to capture the following: City Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Sure, here is a very basic and straightforward ontology model for City in Turtle/RDF format:```turtle@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .ex:City a rdfs:Class .ex:name a rdf:Property ;  rdfs:domain ex:City ;  rdfs:range xsd:string .ex:population a rdf:Property ;  rdfs:domain ex:City ;  rdfs:range xsd:int .ex:country a rdf:Property ;  rdfs:domain ex:City ;  rdfs:range ex:Country .ex:Country a rdfs:Class .```This model defines a class `City` with properties `name` (a string), `population` (an integer), and `country` (which is another class `Country`).
Can you assemble a succinct pattern to convey the following's concept in an ontology: {noun}		Can you assemble a succinct pattern to convey the following's concept in an ontology: City	Concept: City- Subclass Of: Geographic Location- Properties:   - Has Population (DataType: Integer)   - Has Area (DataType: Float)   - Has Mayor (DataType: Person)   - Part Of: Country (DataType: Country)   - Located In: Continent (DataType: Continent)   - Has Postal Code (DataType: String)- Instance Of: City can be "New York City", "London", "Tokyo" etc.This pattern represents "city" as a class, inheriting from a higher class "geographic location". It has properties typical for cities such as population, area, mayor, part of a specific country, located in a particular continent and has a specific postal code. Instances of this class could be any type of city like New York City, London, Tokyo etc.

Can you assemble a succinct pattern to convey the following's concept in an ontology: City Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	```turtle@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .ex:City a rdfs:Class .ex:provide a rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain ex:City ;    rdfs:range rdfs:Resource .```In this example "ex:City" represents a city, "ex:provide" represents the action of providing, and "rdfs:Resource" represents what is being provided. The domain and range specifications state that a city can provide any kind of resource.
Could you devise a simple scheme for representing the following within an ontology context: {noun}		Could you devise a simple scheme for representing the following within an ontology context: City	Sure. In an ontology context, a city could be represented as follows:1. Class: City   - Attributes/Properties:        - cityName : string (the name of the city)        - cityPopulation : integer (the total population of the city)        - cityArea : float (the total area of the city in square kilometers)        - cityCountry : object (references another class "Country" indicating which country the city belongs to)         - cityContinent: object (references another class "Continent" indicating which continent the city is located in)Optional additional attributes can be:  - cityLatitude : float (the latitude of the city)  - cityLongitude : float (the longitude of the city)  - cityElevation : float (the elevation of the city from sea level)   2. Relationship with other classes:   - isCapitalOf : Country (indicates this city is the capital city of a certain country)   - isLocatedIn : State/Region (indicates the city is located in a particular state or region)   - has : Landmark (indicates landmarks located within the city)   This structure can be expanded or modified based on the specific needs of the ontology in question. It provides a flexible method to categorize and relate information that may be used in complex, hierarchical, or associative data structures.

Could you devise a simple scheme for representing the following within an ontology context: City Provide it in valid Turtle/RDF format, excluding any extra text.	Sure, a simple scheme for representing a "City" within an ontology context could look like this in Turtle/RDF format, assuming base prefix "ex" stands for "http://example.com#".```turtle@prefix ex: <http://example.com#> .@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .ex:City rdf:type rdf:Class .``` However, a city often should have properties associated with it, such as name, country, or population. Let's include these in the ontology.```turtle@prefix ex: <http://example.com#> .@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .ex:City rdf:type rdf:Class .ex:name rdf:type rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain ex:City ;    rdfs:range rdfs:Literal .ex:country rdf:type rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain ex:City ;    rdfs:range ex:Country .ex:population rdf:type rdf:Property ;    rdfs:domain ex:City ;    rdfs:range rdfs:Literal .```With this, we can represent cities and have the properties name, country, and population.
