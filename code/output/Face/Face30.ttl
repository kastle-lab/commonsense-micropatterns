Designing an ontology for “Face” involves determining the important attributes and relationships that define what a face is and how it interacts with other entities in a specific context. This design pattern works best for facial recognition or healthcare applications. Classes:1. Class: Face2. Class: Eye3. Class: Nose4. Class: Mouth5. Class: Ear6. Class: Skin7. Class: Features (general class for additional face features like eyebrows, cheekbones)Properties:Object Properties1. hasEye: Relation between Face and Eye classes.2. hasNose: Relation between Face and Nose classes.3. hasMouth: Relation between Face and Mouth classes.4. hasEar: Relation between Face and Ear classes.5. hasSkin: Relation between Face and Skin classes.6. hasFeature: Relation between Face and Features classes.Data Properties1. eyeColor: Data property to store eye color value as string in the Eye class.2. skinColor: Data property to store skin color value as string in the Skin class.3. hairColor: Data property to store hair color value as string in the Feature class.4. noseShape: Data property to store nose shape information in the Nose class.5. earShape: Data property to store ear shape information in the Ear class.Note: The properties largely depend on the intended use of this ontology. For instance, medical applications may need more detailed classes and properties, like different components and diseases related to face.Individuals: Instances of classes. E.g., John's Face, Sarah's Face etc.Code (in Turtle format):@prefix : <http://example.org/faceOntology#> .

:Face a rdfs:Class .
:Eye a rdfs:Class .
:Nose a rdfs:Class .
:Mouth a rdfs:Class .

:Skin a rdfs:Class .
:Features a rdfs:Class .

 Similarly, other properties can be defined.  John's Face example::JohnsFace a :Face ;
 :hasEye :JohnsEye ;
 :hasNose :JohnsNose ;
 :hasMouth :JohnsMouth ;
 :hasEar :JohnsEar ;
 :hasSkin :JohnsSkin ;
 :hasFeature :JohnsFeatures .
  :JohnsEye a :Eye ;
 :eyeColor "Blue"^^xsd:string .
  Similarly, other class instances can be defined.
