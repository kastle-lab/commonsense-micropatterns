 Since the term is very generic, I've made a simple example with an "Others" category and a few potential individuals.Please note that I used a fictional vocabulary (http://example.org/) to avoid collisions with real vocabularies. Replace this with your actual vocabulary.
@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
ex:Others a rdf:Class .
ex:Thing1 a ex:Others .
ex:Thing2 a ex:Others .
ex:Thing3 a ex:Others .
