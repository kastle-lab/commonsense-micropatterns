Creating an ontology model to capture the World in its entirety would be a colossal task due to the vast number of entities, relationships, properties, etc. involved. In reality, such a model would necessitate terabytes or even petabytes of data, going beyond structuring data, needing extensive knowledge in domain-specific sciences and involving various other complexities.However, for the sake of simplicity in this context, I'll provide a very basic ontology of the world focusing on continents, countries, and their populations.
