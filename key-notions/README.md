* `code` -- Python scripts to analyze and generate TTL files from GPT Responses
* `extracted-patterns` -- collection of each key-notion TTL file per GPT Response
* `gpt-responses` -- collection of GPT responses stored of all key-notion queries
* `jupyter-notebooks` -- Python scripts in a Jupyter Notebook used to generate GPT Responses
* `pattern-analysis` -- placeholder if voting on property is implemented
* `patterns` -- the modular ontology design library created from the key-notions
* `project-files` -- auxilliary files extracted from respective projects
* `prompt-results` -- extracted individual key-notion responses from collective GPT Responses
